* Abstract Data Type
* LIFO: Last In, First Out
* push - adds an item as the top item on the stack
* pop - removes the top item on the stack
* peek - gets the top item on the stack without popping it
* Ideal backing data structure: linked list
* We don not use arraylist or vectors because they both are backed by an array.

* O(1) for push,pop, and peek ,when using a linked list
* If you use an array, the push is O(n), because the array may have to be resized
* If you know the maximum number of items that will ever be on the stack, an array can be good choice.
* If the memory is tight, an array might be a good choice
* Linked list is ideal
