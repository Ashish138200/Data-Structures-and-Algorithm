* Hierarchical Data Structure
* Every item in the tree is a node
* Tree have only one root node
* Root node has no parent
* Every non-root node has one parent only
* Parents can have multiple children
* A leaf node has no children
* A singleton tree has only one node- the root
* Depth of the node: no. of edges from root to the node
* Height of the node: is the no. of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf(for leaf node = 0)
* Height of the tree: is the longest path from root node to the leaf
* Level: of the tree contains the nodes that are at same depth(root = 0)
