Three possibilities of deletion:
    1 Node is a leaf
    2 Node has one child
    3 Node has two children

* Need to figure out what the replacement node will be
* Want minimal disruption to the existing tree structure
* Can take the replacement node from the deleted node's left subtree or right subtree
* If taking it from the left subtree, we have to take the largest value in the left subtree
* If taking it from the right subtree, we have to take the smallest value in the right subtree
* Choose one and stick to it
