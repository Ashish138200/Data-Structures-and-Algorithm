* FirstUnsortedIndex = 1 :- this is the first index of the unsorted partition
* i = 0 :- index used to traverse the array from right to left
* newElement = index[1] :- the value we wanna insert into the sorted partition - array[FUI]

* In-place algo
* O(n^2) is the TC but if the values are nearly sorted then it runs in a linear time O(n) because it doesn't have to
  do much shifting.
* It'll take 100 steps to sort 10 items and so on...
* Stable Sort algo
* A lot of shifting in this algo
