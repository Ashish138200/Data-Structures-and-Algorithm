* LastUnsortedIndex = n :- this is the last index of the unsorted partition
* i = 1 :- index used to traverse the array from left to right
* largest = 0 :- index of the largest element in unsorted partition
* First find the largest element in array and put it at the last index and then repeat this expect for the last
  element
  i++
  LastUnsortedIndex = n-1 :- this is the last index of the unsorted partition
* Its is called selection sort because on each traversal we're selecting the largest element and moving it to sorted
  partition
* In-place algo
* O(n^2) is the TC
* It'll take 100 steps to sort 10 items and so on...
* Doesn't require as much swapping as Bubble Sort
* Unstable Sort algo
