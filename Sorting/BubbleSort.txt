* unsortedPartitionIndex = n - this is the last index of the unsorted partition
* i = 0 - index used to traverse the array from left to right
* if the element at index[0]>index[1] we swap the elements
* and if it's large we don't do anything because we wanna put large elements at last
* i++
* if i==n:
    unsortedPartitionIndex = (n-1) - this is the last index of the unsorted partition
    i = 0 - index used to traverse the array from left to right

* In-place algo
* O(n^2) is the TC
* It'll take 100 steps to sort 10 items and so on...
* Algo degrades quickly
* Least efficient algo
* Stable Sort algo
