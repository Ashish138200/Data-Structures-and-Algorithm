* Makes assumptions about the data
* Doesn't Use the comparison
* Counts the no. of occurrence of each value
* Only works with non-negative discrete values(can't work with float,strings)
* Values must be within a specific range
* Not an in-place algo
* O(n)-can achieve this because we're making assumption about the data we're sorting
* If we want the sort to be stable, we've to do some extra steps
