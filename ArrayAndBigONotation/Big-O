1. no. of steps to execute an algo
Complexities:
    Time Complexity(Main): amount of time needed to run/execute an algo.
    Memory Complexity: amount of memory needed to execute an algo..These days memory is cheap so not a problem.
Worst case Scenario:-
    Big-O-Notation:way of expressing the no. of items that an algo have to deal with
            Convention:
   Best         O(1) : Constant
    |           O(log n) : Logarithmic [base 2]
                O(n^0.5): Square root
    |           O(n) : Linear Time complexity
    |           O(n logn) :n log-star n
                O(n^2) : Quadratic
                O(2^n):
  Worst         O(n!):
